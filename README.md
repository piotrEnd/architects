## architects

**Information architecture:**

The [original site](http://modernhouses.pl/)  needs several improvements, so I have reduced multi-level-navigation, merged sections 'about' and 'offer', removed dead-content, improved resposiveness. 

**Design:**

Website uses Node.js, Express framwork and EJS view engine to manage content. Skeleton of the page is a mixture of XY-grid and flexbox. Aesthetics comes from Foundation v6 framework. Architects are designers themselves. For this reason I have reconstructed the existing site trying to visually keep with the original concept.
