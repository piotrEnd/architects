# architects

My sister in law and her husband take their chances as independent architects. They have already a website (http://modernhouses.pl), but I think it needs some upgrades and improvements. I would rather avoid the discussion about design with them, but some minor changes have been made ;p

Right, what have we got here?
* Foundation 6.4.2 as framework (XY grid + flexbox)
* gulp.js wits sass as build system
* Express.js as web application network for Node.js
