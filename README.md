**Information architecture:**

The [original website](http://modernhouses.pl/) required reconstruction and multiple enhancements. I found the multi-level navigation to be cumbersome, especially on mobile devices. To address this, I consolidated the 'about' and 'offer' sections, removed outdated content, and improved the site's responsiveness.

**Design:**

The website utilizes Node.js, the Express framework, and the EJS view engine for content management. The page layout is a fusion of the XY-grid and flexbox. The visual appeal is drawn from the Foundation v6 framework. I undertook the task of reconstructing the existing site to ensure its visual continuity with the original concept.
